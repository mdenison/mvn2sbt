I assume you allready have installed the Simple Build Tool.

Usage:

First we need to publish it (at the moment we are going to do this local):
> git clone http://github.com/weiglewilczek/mvn2sbt.git
> cd mvn2sbt
> sbt update publish-local

Then we can define our processor in a different sbt project as followed:
> *mvn2sbt is com.weiglewilczek.mvn2sbt mvn2sbt 0.1

Converting a pom.xml:
> mvn2sbt pom.xml

Please be aware of that the sbt project file might be overwritten, if you allready have one in the sbt project where mvn2sbt is called!
