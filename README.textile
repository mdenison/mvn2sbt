I assume you allready have installed the Simple Build Tool.

h2. Usage:

h3. Clone this repository and publish the project local: 
<pre><code>
$ git clone http://github.com/weiglewilczek/mvn2sbt.git
$ cd mvn2sbt
$ sbt update publish-local
</code></pre>

h3. Define our processor.
<pre><code>
> *mvn2sbt is com.weiglewilczek.mvn2sbt mvn2sbt 0.1
</code></pre>

h3. Converting a pom.xml -> project/build/project.scala (Please use a project without a SBT project file):
<pre><code>
> mvn2sbt pom.xml
</code></pre>

Please be aware of that the sbt project file might be overwritten, if you allready have one in the sbt project where mvn2sbt is called!

mvn2sbt is open source software licensed under the "Eclipse Public License v1.0":http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html. Just use it!
