I assume you allready have installed the Simple Build Tool.

h2. Usage:

h3. First we need to publish it (at the moment we are going to do this local):
<pre><code>
> git clone http://github.com/weiglewilczek/mvn2sbt.git
> cd mvn2sbt
> sbt update publish-local
</code></pre>

h3. Then we can define our processor in a different sbt project as followed:
<pre><code>
> *mvn2sbt is com.weiglewilczek.mvn2sbt mvn2sbt 0.1
</code></pre>

h3. Converting a pom.xml:
<pre><code>
> mvn2sbt pom.xml
</code></pre>

Please be aware of that the sbt project file might be overwritten, if you allready have one in the sbt project where mvn2sbt is called!

mvn2sbt is open source software licensed under the "Eclipse Public License v1.0":http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html. Just use it!
